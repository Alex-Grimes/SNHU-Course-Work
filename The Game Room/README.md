Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

 

Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. 

The staff at The Gaming Room does not know how to set up the environment. To facilitate the development of the web-based version of the gaming app, they will need your help in streamlining the development. You have been asked to prepare a software design document and begin developing the game application, addressing their software requirements. Keep in mind that the hardware requirements will come later as a result of the software application decisions. Your technical manager will want to review your progress with this client. 

Specifically, the client has requested that the following software requirements be met for the game application: 

A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved. 

Each team will have multiple players assigned to it. 

Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name. 

Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

 

I had a great time digging into the ins and outs of operating systems I didn’t have much experience with. I Have spent my whole life using Mac OS and Windows really exploring Linux and some of the more unique systems like game consoles and mobile OS’s. 

 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 

 

Reading a building UML Diagrams is so helpful in figuring out what it is exactly that you are building. An ounce of planning is worth a pound of work. Also deciphering the exact type of program that a user is trying to build and what expectations they have for the application is extremely important.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

 

I would like to take some more time and really explore making this application into one that could be packaged alone and run on both ARM and x86 architectures without the use of web servers and hosting. Essentially as it is built now it would require a network connection and I would like to get rid of that requirement.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

 

I really make an effort to not only listen to what it is the user says that they want to be implemented but also what they will need and what their end goals are. Sometimes people need an expert opinion to be able to recognize holes in their plan. Sometimes these are technical requirements that are not possible sometimes it’s a technology that far surpasses their original expectations that they may just not be aware exists.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 

 

I approached this project like any other I have done in the past I analyze the request and break it down into workable segments. This is my go-to for any project looking at the large picture can be overwhelming so breaking it into digestible chunks and taking them on and testing each chunk individually makes it easy to combine near the end of the project.
