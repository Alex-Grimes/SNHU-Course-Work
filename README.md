# SNHU-Course-Work


    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
    This Project Was a banking application that Showed the user the power of investing by calculating how much they could make simply by saveing regularly and collecting intrest. 
    
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    I feel like my Print report class came out very well it clearly presents the data and and allows the user to enter the needed data.
    
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I feel like i couldve broken my code up more into additional classes i actually attempted to do this at the beggining of the project but ran into issues and had to scale back to meet the deadline of the assignment 
    
    
    Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I didnt struggle much with writeing this code the tools i used are the same i have since i started years ago google, stackoverflow, and the newest one zybooks it provided some good snippets of code that i could use as an example/template for my own work.  
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    
    The building of constructors and deconstructors will be critical to any C++ project the formatting code i learned to get my digits to appear as i wanted will also be very useful and the menu concept could deffinetly be repurpoused into other projects.
    
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
    This program was made readable and maintainable by addint inline notes and clearly named objects that allow you to at a glance.To know what a function does or why it is being called without this you would have to read everyline of code to decipher what is being done.
