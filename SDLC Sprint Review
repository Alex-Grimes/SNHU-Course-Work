How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to interpret user needs is top ask them for there needs and take notes. Dureing the user story process you can get a feeling for which items are the most wanted/needed. 
Based off the user stories you can also prioritze the requests into this needs to work and it would be nice to have this feature.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs in a agile way i break the program into bite sized pieces and work on them individually adjusting as need be to meet the best end product that can be completed in each sprint section. 
I hope to implement this time box idea more into my work in the future. Ive always just grinded at something until it was complete. Sometimes this method worked out other times i wasted way to much time on insignifcant things in the grand scheme of the project.
Time Boxs could help limit this drastically. By giving myself a hard out time i can focus on makeing what is my best possible creation in the time provided.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think being a good team member means being open and willing to learn and adjust. 
So much of the process requires open communication and the ability to take constructive criticism well. 
The other thing to keep in mind is software development is so large no one person has all the tools or documentation memorized.
Due to the size of the subject matter we all have to look for help in one way or another and from anyone on the team. 
If your to prideful to ask for help i think that would make for a bad team member.
